# Simple_Egg_Platformer_Demo-
A Godot platformer demo, which uses  clean GDScript, organised scene structure, and solid implementation of movement, collisions and basic enemy behaviour.

## About This Demo

This repository contains a clean, self-contained demo extracted from a larger Godot game project I am actively developing.  
I will be working on finishing the full project over time, but this demo shows the underlying structure and coding style of the complete game without including unfinished or unnecessary files.
The full game includes additional levels, assets and mechanics, but it is still in progress, so I have only included the core gameplay systems here to keep the repository lightweight and focused on the engineering aspects:
• movement and collision logic  
• enemy behaviour  
• reusable scene components  
• platform physics  
• collectibles and interactions  



## Gameplay Summary
The player controls a small egg character that can:
• Move left and right
• Jump and fall using physics
• Land on platforms
• Collect gems (RedGem, YellowGem)
• Interact with portals
• Avoid enemies
• Progress across small level scenes

## What This Project Demonstrates
Although simple, the project reflects an engineering-oriented approach rather than a purely artistic one, emphasising clarity, reusability and correctness.
This project shows my ability to:
• Write clean and structured GDScript
• Design reusable scenes that improve maintainability
• Implement core platformer mechanics
• Handle collisions, physics, and object interactions
• Organise a small but complete Godot project
• Think about code structure and separation of logic
